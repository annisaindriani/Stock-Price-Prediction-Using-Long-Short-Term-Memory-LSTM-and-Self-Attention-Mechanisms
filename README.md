# Stock Price Prediction Using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Self-Attention Mechanisms
## Description
This project aims to predict the stock performance of Company X using deep learning techniques in the finance sector. The dataset, consisting of 3,808 rows and 7 columns, was analyzed with a focus on the 'Date' and 'Close' columns. Initial exploration of the dataset identified challenges inherent in time series data, necessitating appropriate preprocessing to prepare it for analysis. The data was then divided into input and output segments with a window size of 5 and a horizon of 1, establishing a structured framework for further evaluation.

The dataset was separated into training, validation, and test sets in an 80:10:10 ratio. A baseline deep learning architecture utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks was created, followed by the incorporation of a Sequential Self-Attention Mechanism to enhance the model's ability to capture temporal dependencies. The performance of the model was assessed on the test set using relevant evaluation metrics, justified based on the architecture employed. Additionally, a line chart was generated to compare the prediction results of both models against actual values, providing a visual representation of the model's effectiveness in predicting stock performance.
